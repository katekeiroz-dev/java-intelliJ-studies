Arrays can store any type of data

1. array of primitives - int
2. array of objects - String
3.Array of objects - Product


1 - Primitive types:
//when have square brackets are primatives arrays, made by java
int numbers[] = new int[10]
byte smallNumbers[] = new byte[4]
char characteres[] = new char[26]

3.Array of objects - Product


 primitive array in Java is an array that holds elements of a primitive data type such as int,
  double, char, etc. Unlike arrays of objects, primitive arrays store values directly in memory rather than references to objects.

Example of a Primitive Array in Java
java
Copy
Edit
public class PrimitiveArrayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = new int[5]; // Array of integers with size 5
        numbers[0] = 10;
        numbers[1] = 20;
        numbers[2] = 30;

        // Iterating through the array
        for (int num : numbers) {
            System.out.println(num);
        }
    }
}
Key Characteristics of Primitive Arrays
Fixed Size: The size is defined at the time of creation and cannot be changed.

Memory Efficient: Stores values directly, making them more memory-efficient than object arrays.

Default Values: When declared, elements are initialized to default values:

int, short, byte, long → 0

float, double → 0.0

char → '\u0000' (null character)

boolean → false

Faster Access: Since there is no need to dereference objects, primitive arrays offer better performance than arrays
of objects.
