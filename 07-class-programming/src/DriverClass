Driver Class in a Java Program
A driver class in Java refers to a class that contains the main() method and is responsible for starting the execution of a program.
It serves as the entry point of the application and is used to test and run other classes.

Best Practices for a Driver Class
*  Keep the driver class separate from the logic classes.
*  Only use the main() method for initiating objects and calling methods.
*  Keep it cleanâ€”avoid putting too much logic in the driver class.


Key Features of a Driver Class
Contains the main() Method

Every Java program must have a main() method where execution starts.
The main() method signature:


public static void main(String[] args)



Creates and Uses Objects of Other Classes

The driver class usually creates instances of other classes and calls their methods.
Handles Input and Output

Often, it interacts with the user by printing output and reading input.
