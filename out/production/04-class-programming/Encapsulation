Encapsulation (data hiding) - it is fundamental object oriented concept
Encapsulation in Java – A Detailed Explanation
What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
It refers to the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit,
typically a class. Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps in data hiding and protects the integrity of the data.

Encapsulation is implemented in Java using access modifiers (private, protected, public, and default) to control the visibility of class members.

Key Principles of Encapsulation
Declare the class variables (fields) as private – This ensures that the data cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
Provide public getter and setter methods – These methods allow controlled access to private fields.
Encapsulation improves data security – Since data is hidden, it prevents accidental modifications.
Encapsulation supports maintainability and flexibility – Internal implementation can be changed without affecting external code.
